## Multimodal Data Visualization

Multimodal Data Visualization is used to visualize the video as well as other application metrics. It uses Grafana for visualization purpose. Depending on the mode, which is selected, this service preloads the Grafana Dashboard. For e.g., in EVAM mode, *Pipeline Server Dashboard* along with other configuration is loaded on the service startup. So, when the user opens Grafana 3000 port, Pipeline Server Dashboard is readily available there to see the data and video streaming from EVA. Similarly, in EII mode, *EII Video and Time Series Dashboard* is loaded to get visualize the data from EII.
